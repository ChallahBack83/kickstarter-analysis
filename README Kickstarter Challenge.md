# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Our client is preparing her own Kickstarter campaign to fund her new play. The purpose of this analysis is to discover and track trends among theater focused Kickstarter campaigns.  The gathered data will help our client prepare and increase the likelihood of creating a successful campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

First, I took some time to explore and understand the full scope of the Kickstarter data. It includes information on a variety of **types** of Kickstarter campaigns from around the world, the amount of their goals, amount of pledges, number of backers, and the outcome of the campaign.  To provide some information at a glance, I used conditional formatting to highlight **successful** versus **failed** campaigns as well as a heat map of the percentage funded.

After a general look at the overall Kickstarter data, I narrowed my focus to the **theater** parent category by separating the **category/subcategory** column using the "Convert Text to Columns Wizard". By doing so, I could generate pivot tables and charts to visualize the data for individual categories and subcategories. In this case, I specifically focused on **theater** and **plays** since our client's campaign falls in this group.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
